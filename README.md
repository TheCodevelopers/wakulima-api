Farmhand tool

This applications purpose is to connect farmers or land owners who do not have enough funds/capital for raising field crops,livestock or both with a user(investor) who has funds that theyâ€™d like to invest in agriculture. This would also help create a network of farmers, markets traders, merchants of (fertilizer, seeds, farm machinery etc) that would keep track of any data on transactions between any party. Application will have Tracker tools(can be TM) to track the plants or livestock process from start to finish. This process would show status of tasks( showing to do, in progress or done).

The Application will also have an Accountability tool(Usable in other projects- can be TM) that will be used to provide transparency and accountability by providing a follow up that shows: issue, status and chain of custody, dates of actions taken, organization/member of staff involved , transactions occurred , any picture proof, reviews or feedback from people involved. This will also have the ability to sync calendars of networks involved to show meetings,sales,training and keep track of meeting attendance/punctuality etc.
